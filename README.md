# Predicting rain in Australia using logistic regression
Performing an EDA and building a logistic regression to predict rain occurrence 

## Why this dataset?
There are several reasons why weather forcasting is important. Not only does it make an uncertain future a little more certain, it also helps people to plan ahead for their day. On a more serious note, without accurate weather forecasts, people end up in dangerous situations they were unprepared for and end up injured or worse. Pilots need to know the weather to plan their flights, sailors need to know what the weather will be like to plan their sails, and farmers need to know what the weather will be like to help them plan watering, fertilizer and pesticide application, and harvest activities, to name a few.
